This is a small desktop app I built for my Java class using Java, JavaFX, and MySQL. Users can create accounts and send adoption requests for pets, which automatically generates a PDF with their info. Admins can manage the pet listings (add/edit/delete). A very simple project to practice Java basics, interfaces, and working with a database.
